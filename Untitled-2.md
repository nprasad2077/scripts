## You

Implement tests for the following code

```python
import os
import shutil

# Specify the paths
source_folder = '/mnt/e/vids'
target_folder = '/mnt/e/ffmpeg/media'

# Keyword to search for
keyword = '*' # Change the keyword to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison

# Walk through the source folder and its subdirectories
for root, dirs, files in os.walk(source_folder):
    for file in files:
        if keyword.lower() in file.lower(): # Perform case-insensitive comparison
            source_path = os.path.join(root, file)
            target_path = os.path.join(target_folder, file)
            shutil.move(source_path, target_path)
            print(f"Moved {file} to {target_folder}")
```

To test the given code, we can use the `unittest` module in Python to write unit tests. Here's an example of how we can implement tests for the given code:

```python
import os
import shutil
import unittest

class TestFileMove(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        self.source_folder = "/mnt/e/vids"
        self.target_folder = "/mnt/e/ffmpeg/media"
        self.keyword = "*"

    def test_file_move(self):
        # Move a file that matches the keyword
        test_file = "test_file.txt"
        source_path = os.path.join(self.source_folder, test_file)
        target_path = os.path.join(self.target_folder, test_file)

        # Create the test file in the source folder
        with open(source_path, 'w') as f:
            f.write("This is a test")

        # Call the function to be tested
        move_files_with_keyword(self.source_folder, self.target_folder, self.keyword)

        # Assert that the file has been moved to the target folder
        self.assertTrue(os.path.exists(target_path))

        # Clean up the files
        os.remove(target_path)

    def test_no_match(self):
        # Move files with no match for the keyword
        test_file_1 = "file1.txt"
        test_file_2 = "file2.txt"
        source_path_1 = os.path.join(self.source_folder, test_file_1)
        source_path_2 = os.path.join(self.source_folder, test_file_2)

        # Create the test files in the source folder
        with open(source_path_1, 'w') as f1, open(source_path_2, 'w') as f2:
            f1.write("Test file 1")
            f2.write("Test file 2")

        # Call the function to be tested
        move_files_with_keyword(self.source_folder, self.target_folder, self.keyword)

        # Assert that the files have not been moved
        self.assertFalse(os.path.exists(os.path.join(self.target_folder, test_file_1)))
        self.assertFalse(os.path.exists(os.path.join(self.target_folder, test_file_2)))

        # Clean up the files
        os.remove(source_path_1)
        os.remove(source_path_2)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

The `setUp` method is used to set up any common data or configuration needed for the tests. In this case, we are setting the source and target folders, as well as the keyword.

The `test_file_move` method tests the scenario where a file matching the keyword is found in the source folder. It creates a temporary test file in the source folder, calls the `move_files_with_keyword` function, and then asserts that the file has been moved to the target folder. Finally, it cleans up the temporary file.

The `test_no_match` method tests the scenario where no files match the keyword. It creates two temporary test files in the source folder, calls the `move_files_with_keyword` function, and then asserts that the files have not been moved. Finally, it cleans up the temporary files.

Note: You'll need to replace `move_files_with_keyword` with the actual name of the function you are testing. If the code provided is the complete code, you can wrap it inside a function called `move_files_with_keyword` to make it testable.
