To implement tests for the given code, you can use the `unittest` module in Python. 

Here's an example of how you can write tests for the provided code:

```python
import unittest
import os
import shutil

class FileMoveTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        # Create a temporary directory to use as the source folder
        self.source_folder = '/tmp/source_folder'
        os.makedirs(self.source_folder)
        
        # Create some test files in the source folder
        for i in range(5):
            file_path = os.path.join(self.source_folder, f'test_file_{i}.txt')
            with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
                f.write(f'Test content {i}')
        
        # Create a temporary directory to use as the target folder
        self.target_folder = '/tmp/target_folder'
        os.makedirs(self.target_folder)
        
    def tearDown(self):
        # Clean up the temporary folders
        shutil.rmtree(self.source_folder)
        shutil.rmtree(self.target_folder)
    
    def test_file_move(self):
        # Specify the keyword to search for
        keyword = 'test_file_'
        
        # Call the function or code block that performs the file move
        for root, dirs, files in os.walk(self.source_folder):
            for file in files:
                if keyword.lower() in file.lower():
                    source_path = os.path.join(root, file)
                    target_path = os.path.join(self.target_folder, file)
                    shutil.move(source_path, target_path)

        # Verify that the files were moved correctly
        moved_files = os.listdir(self.target_folder)
        self.assertEqual(len(moved_files), 5)  # Asserts that 5 files were moved
        
        # Add more assertions here as needed to test specific conditions or behaviors
    
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

In this example, the `setUp` method creates a temporary source folder and target folder before each test case. It also creates some test files in the source folder.

The `tearDown` method is responsible for cleaning up the temporary folders after each test case.

The `test_file_move` method represents a test case. It performs the file move operation using the provided code and then asserts that the expected behavior is met. For example, it asserts that 5 files were moved to the target folder.

You can add additional assertions or test cases to cover different scenarios or conditions as needed. To run the tests, you can execute the script or use a test runner like `unittest.main()`.
